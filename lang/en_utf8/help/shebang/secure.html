<p>
If in your hosting environment you are unable to restrict access to the
"secure/post.php" file using Apache configs or an .htaccess file, then
you can optionally supply a username and password here.<br />
<br />
If you can secure the directory/file with Apache configs or an .htaccess
file, there is no need to use this feature, and both the Username and
Password fields should be left blank.

<p>
<ul>
<li>Username - a username to use for access</li>
<li>Password - a corresponding password to use for access</li>
<li>HTTP Auth. Method - Digest (default) or Basic (clear-text)</li>
</ul>
