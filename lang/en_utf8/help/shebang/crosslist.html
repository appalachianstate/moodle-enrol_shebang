<p>These settings affect how cross-listed course sections are handled.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Process course cross-listing - Enables processing of group &lt;membership&gt; messages, i.e. cross-listed child courses.</li>
<li>Implement cross-listing using - Determines whether to implement a cross-listed course as either a metacourse, or a regular course where enrollments are re-directed to the parent course. With metacourses, enrollments are made in the child course, as usual, and the Moodle syncronizes enrollments.</li>
<li>Group enrollees based on child-courses - Create groups in the parent course that correspond to the child courses, and populate them accordingly.</li>     
<li>Cross-list Fullname Prefix - Prefix for the cross-list parent course full name.</li>
<li>Cross-list Shortname Prefix - Prefix for the cross-list parent course short name.</li>
<li>Hide child courses when cross-listed - Makes a course hidden after it has been designated as a child course.</li>  
</ul>
